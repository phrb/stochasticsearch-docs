\section{Architecture of the Package}
\label{sec:arch}

OpenTuner search spaces are defined by \emph{Configurations}, composed of
different \emph{Parameter} types. Each type has restricted bounds, and
implements its own manipulation functions, enabling the exploration of the
search space.  OpenTuner implements ensembles of optimization and Machine
Learning techniques that perform well in different problem domains.  The
results found during the search process are shared between techniques through a
common results database. OpenTuner uses \emph{meta-techniques} for coordinating
the distribution of resources between techniques in an ensemble.  An OpenTuner
application can implement its own search techniques and meta-techniques.
